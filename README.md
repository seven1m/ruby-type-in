# Ruby Type In

These are some exercises I'm using to teach my kids how to code with Ruby.

The course is mostly in the style of a [type-in](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type-in_program)
of the early 80s. You should print these exercises out and have the kids type
and run the programs one-at-a-time. Discussion and experimentation are highly
encouraged!

The students are expected to become familiarized with basic concepts like
control flow, variables, etc., but mastery is not the goal.
